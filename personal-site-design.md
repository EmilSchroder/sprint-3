Primary Purpose?

To practice web design and let other course members see what I have learnt and how I have struggled with the tasks  that they are also completing.

Target Audience?

Other EDA Dev Academy course members as well as EDA staff. Desktop/laptop PCs are primary, mobile secondary.

Interaction and Experience?

I want viewers to easily view the content that I create for them and be able to show what they think about the things I have written. They should feel confronted by the visuals, but have no problem finding information.

How to create UX?

Stark, simple colours. Reduce the number of clicks-to-info in order to reduce time to blog posts. Make the layout intuative to view and use.
