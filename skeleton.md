What happens when resize < 550px? How does that work?

At 550px the screen is at its native state (as it is designed mobile first) of being optimised for mobile, which puts more emphasis on narrow info formatting as opposed to scanning right across a page.

When moving to a larger format a media request is triggered to apply a different set of rules on the page.
